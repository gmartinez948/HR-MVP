# HR-MVP

I am creating a Spotify recommender app.

The app will take in a genre from a search bar, and return a list of songs..
There will be a save feature that allows users to save songs to the database..
There will also be a "go to saved songs" feature that will fetch the saved songs from the db
and serve them back to the user..

ToDo:

1. Create a useContext provider so that I can manage state more effectively and reduce clutter of code on App.jsx

2. Create an AppBar that will hold the LogIn and LogOut functionality..

3. Create a landing page that will load a photo and prompt you to login. The photo should take up the entire page as a statically rendered photo, this way the user has a better experience.

4. Create algorithm to have users enter a mood (generated from a drop down list) and return the songs that fit that mood.

5. Create cross functionality with Spotify to add songs to your existing playlists or create a new playlist.

6. CSS styling..

7. figure out why the preview.url doesn't change when switching playlists.. The same song from before plays rather than the new title

8. Rank these from important to non-important.

9. [optional]: Convert to typescript.
